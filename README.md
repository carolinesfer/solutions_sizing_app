This repository provides a ready-to-use application template for building and deploying agentic workflows with
multi-agent frameworks, a fastapi backend server, a react frontend, and an MCP server. The template
streamlines the process of setting up new workflows with minimal configuration requirements.
They support local development and testing, as well as one-command deployments to production environments
within DataRobot.

# Installation

```diff
-IMPORTANT: This repository is only compatible with macOS and Linux operating systems.
```

> If you are using Windows, consider using a [DataRobot codespace](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/workbench/wb-notebook/codespaces/index.html), Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), or a virtual machine running a supported OS.

Ensure you have the following tools installed and on your system at the required version (or newer).
It is **recommended to install the tools system-wide** rather than in a virtual environment to ensure they are available in your terminal session.

## Prerequisite tools

The following tools are required to install and run the agent templates.
For detailed installation steps, see [Installation instructions](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/agentic-ai/agentic-develop/agentic-install.html#installation-instructions) in the DataRobot documentation.

| Tool         | Version    | Description                     | Installation guide            |
|--------------|------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **git**      | >= 2.30.0  | A version control system.       | [git installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) |
| **uv**       | >= 0.6.10  | A Python package manager.       | [uv installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)     |
| **Pulumi**   | >= 3.163.0 | An Infrastructure as Code tool. | [Pulumi installation guide](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/download-install/)        |
| **Taskfile** | >= 3.43.3  | A task runner.                  | [Taskfile installation guide](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation)                  |

> **IMPORTANT**: You will also need a compatible C++ compiler and build tools installed on your system to compile some Python packages.

# Create and deploy your agent

```diff
-IMPORTANT: Ensure all prerequisites are installed before proceeding.
```

This guide walks you through setting up an agentic workflow using one of several provided templates.
It returns a Markdown (`.md`) document about your specified topic based on the research of a series of agents.
The example workflow contains these 3 agents:

- **Researcher**: Gathers information on a given topic using web search.
- **Writer**: Creates a document based on the research.
- **Editor**: Reviews and edits the document for clarity and correctness.

## Clone the agent template repository

The method for cloning the repository is dependent on whether your DataRobot application instance&mdash;either Managed SaaS (cloud) or Self-Managed (on-premise).

### Cloud users

You can either clone the repository to your local machine using Git or [download it as a ZIP file](https://github.com/datarobot-community/datarobot-agent-templates/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/datarobot-community/datarobot-agent-templates.git
cd datarobot-agent-templates
```

### On-premise users

Clone the release branch for your installation using Git, replacing `[YOUR_DATA_ROBOT_VERSION]` with the version of DataRobot you are using:

```bash
git clone -b release/[YOUR_DATA_ROBOT_VERSION] https://github.com/datarobot-community/datarobot-agent-templates.git
cd datarobot-agent-templates
```

> **NOTE**: To customize or track your own workflows, you can 
> [fork this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo), 
> [change the remote URL](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/managing-remote-repositories), or 
> [create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

## Locate your DataRobot API key and endpoint

The section after this requires you to add your DataRobot API key and endpoint to the environment variables file.
See the [DataRobot API keys and endpoints](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/get-started/acct-mgmt/acct-settings/api-key-mgmt.html) documentation for specific steps on how to locate them.

## Configure environment variables

Create an `.env` file in the root directory before running any commands:

1. Copy the template environment file.

  ```bash
  cp .env.template .env
  ```

2. Edit the file with your preferred text editor.

  ```bash
  nano .env  # or vim .env, code .env, etc.
  ```

3. Paste the DataRobot API key and endpoint that you copied in [Locate your DataRobot API key and endpoint](#locate-your-datarobot-api-key-and-endpoint) into your `.env` file. Leave other variables at their default values during setup.

```bash
# Your DataRobot API token.
# Refer to https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/api/api-quickstart/index.html#configure-your-environment for help.
DATAROBOT_API_TOKEN=<YOUR_API_KEY>

# The URL of your DataRobot instance API.
DATAROBOT_ENDPOINT=<YOUR_API_ENDPOINT>
```

## Install and start your agent

Run the script to install all your agent's dependencies:

```bash
task install
```

## Deploy your agent

Next, deploy your agent to DataRobot, which requires a Pulumi login.
If you do not have one, use `pulumi login --local` for local login or create a free account at [the Pulumi website](https://app.pulumi.com/signup).

```bash
task deploy
```

During the deploy process, you will be asked to provide a **Pulumi stack name** (e.g., `myagent`, `test`, etc.) to identify your DataRobot resources.
Once you have provided one, the deploy process provides a preview link.
Review the Pulumi preview and approve changes by typing `yes` or pressing `Enter`.

> **NOTE**: If prompted to perform an update, select `yes` and press `Enter`.

Deployment takes several minutes.
When complete, a resource summary with important IDs/URLs is displayed:

```bash
Outputs:
    AGENT_CREWAI_DEPLOYMENT_ID                                    : "1234567890abcdef"
    Agent Custom Model Chat Endpoint [agentic-test] [agent_crewai]: "https://[YOUR_DATAROBOT_ENDPOINT]/api/v2/genai/agents/fromCustomModel/1234567890abcdef/chat/"
    Agent Deployment Chat Endpoint [agentic-test] [agent_crewai]  : "https://[YOUR_DATAROBOT_ENDPOINT]/api/v2/deployments/1234567890abcdef/chat/completions"
    Agent Execution Environment ID [agentic-test] [agent_crewai]  : "68fbc0eab1af04e6982ff7b1"
    Agent Playground URL [agentic-test] [agent_crewai]            : "https://[YOUR_DATAROBOT_ENDPOINT]/usecases/68fbc0eafb98d9d6d59c65db/agentic-playgrounds/1234567890abcdef/comparison/chats"
    LLM_DEFAULT_MODEL                                             : "datarobot/azure/gpt-4o-mini"
    USE_DATAROBOT_LLM_GATEWAY                                     : "1"

Resources:
    + 10 created

Duration: 2m12s

```

### Find your deployment ID

The deployment ID is displayed in the terminal output after running `task deploy`.
In the example output at the end of the previous section, the deployment ID is `1234567890abcdef`.

For more details, see [Model information](https://docs.datarobot.com/en/docs/mlops/deployment/deploy-methods/add-deploy-info.html#model-information) in the DataRobot documentation.

## Test your deployed agent

Use the CLI to test your deployed agent.
In the following command, replace <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID> with your actual deployment ID from the previous step:

```bash
task agent:cli -- execute-deployment --user_prompt 'Tell me about Generative AI' --deployment_id <YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID>
```

> **NOTE**: The command may take a few minutes to complete.

Once the repsonse has been processed, the response displays.
The output below is an example, but your actual response will vary.

```bash

# Terms & Conditions

## 1\. GENERAL TERMS

1.1 Your use of the Pulumi Services is governed by this Agreement (the
"Agreement"). "Pulumi" means Pulumi Corporation, located at 601 Union St.,
Suite 1415, Seattle, WA 98101 and its subsidiaries or affiliates involved in
providing the Pulumi Services. The “Pulumi Services” means the services Pulumi
makes available through this website, the Pulumi platform, and any other
software or services offered by Pulumi in connection to any of those.

1.2 In order to use the Pulumi Services, you must first agree to the Terms.
You can agree to the Terms by actually using the Pulumi Services. You
understand and agree that Pulumi will treat your use of the Pulumi Services as
acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

1.3 You may not use the Pulumi Services if you are a person barred from
receiving the Pulumi Services under the laws of the United States or other
countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you
use the Pulumi Services.

1.4 You agree that purchases of Pulumi Services are not contingent on the
delivery of any future functionality or features or dependent on any oral or
written public comments made by Pulumi or any of its affiliates regarding
future functionality or features.

  

## 2\. USE OF THE PULUMI SERVICES

2.1 You must provide accurate and complete registration information when you
register to use the Pulumi Services. You are responsible for the security of

2.3 You agree not to (a) access (or attempt to access) the administrative
interface of the Pulumi Services by any means other than through the interface
that is provided by Pulumi in connection with the Pulumi Services, unless you
have been specifically allowed to do so in a separate agreement with Pulumi,
or (b) engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Pulumi
Services (or the servers and networks which are connected to the Service).

2.4 Your account’s Service Capacity has “hard” and “soft” usage limits, as set
forth on the Order Form and further explained at
[https://www.pulumi.com/acceptable-use#quota](/acceptable-use#quota). The
Pulumi Services do not permit you to exceed the hard usage limits. Pulumi
reserves the right to enforce soft usage limits in its sole discretion.
Repeated exceeding of the hard or soft usage limits may lead to termination of
your account.

  

## 3\. SERVICES POLICIES AND PRIVACY

3.1 You agree to comply with the Pulumi Acceptable Use Policy available at
[https://www.pulumi.com/acceptable-use](/acceptable-use) (the "Acceptable Use
Policy") which is incorporated herein by this reference and which may be
updated from time to time.

3.2 The Pulumi Services shall be subject to the privacy policy available at
[https://www.pulumi.com/privacy](/privacy). You agree to the use of your data
in accordance with such privacy policy.

3.3 Pulumi shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Pulumi
Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for planned downtime
(of which you are given notice), or any unavailability caused by circumstances
beyond Pulumi’s reasonable control, including without limitation, acts of God,
acts of government, floods, fires, earthquakes, civil unrest, acts of terror,
strikes or other labor problems (other than those involving Pulumi employees),
Internet service provider failures or delays, or denial of service attacks.

  

## 4\. PAYMENT OF FEES

4.1 You will pay Pulumi the then applicable fees described in the Order Form
for the Pulumi Services and Implementation Services in accordance with the
terms therein (the “Fees”). If your use of the Services exceeds the Service
Capacity set forth on the Order Form or otherwise requires the payment of
additional fees (per the terms of this Agreement), you will be billed for such
usage and you agree to pay the additional fees in the manner provided herein.
Pulumi reserves the right to change the Fees or applicable charges and to
institute new charges and Fees at the end of the Initial Service Term or then
current renewal term, upon thirty (30) days prior notice to you (which may be
sent by email). If you believe that Pulumi has billed you incorrectly, you
must contact Pulumi no later than 60 days after the closing date on the first
billing statement in which the error or problem appeared, in order to receive
an adjustment or credit. Inquiries should be directed to Pulumi’s customer
support department.

4.2 Pulumi may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment
for invoices issued in any given month must be received by Pulumi thirty (30)
days after the mailing date of the invoice. Unpaid amounts are subject to a
finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum
permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may
result in immediate termination of your account. You are responsible for all
taxes associated with Pulumi Services other than U.S. taxes based on Pulumi’s
net income.

4.3 If any charge owed by you is 30 days or more overdue, Pulumi may, without
limiting its other rights and remedies, suspend your access to Pulumi Services
until such amounts are paid in full, provided we have given you 10 or more
days' prior notice that your account is overdue.

4.4 Unless otherwise stated, Pulumi’s fees do not include any taxes, levies,
duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including but not
limited to value-added, sales and use, or withholding taxes, assessable by any
local, state, provincial, federal or foreign jurisdiction (collectively,
"Taxes"). You are responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your
purchases hereunder. If Pulumi has the legal obligation to pay or collect
Taxes for which you are responsible under this paragraph, the appropriate
amount shall be invoiced to and paid by you, unless you provide Pulumi with a
valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing
authority. For clarity, Pulumi is solely responsible for taxes assessable
against it based on its income, property and employees.

4.5 You may not develop Cloud Applications, as defined in 5.2, to simulate,
act, or otherwise access the Pulumi Services to avoid incurring fees
associated with exceeding the hard and soft limits outlined in your Pulumi
Services Order Form.

  

## 5\. CONTENT AND CLOUD APPLICATIONS

such content originated. All such information is referred to below as the

15.1 The Terms, including all Order Forms, constitute the whole legal
agreement between you and Pulumi and govern your use of the Pulumi Services
(but excluding any services which Pulumi may provide to you under a separate
written agreement), and completely replace any prior agreements between you
and Pulumi in relation to the Pulumi Services.

15.2 There are no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. The parties are
independent contractors, and nothing in these Terms creates an agency,
partnership or joint venture.

15.3 If Pulumi provides you with a translation of the English language version
of these Terms, the English language version of these Terms will control if
there is any conflict.

15.4 You agree that Pulumi may provide you with notices, including those
regarding changes to the Terms, by email, regular mail, or postings on the
Pulumi Services. By providing Pulumi your email address, you consent to our
using the email address to send you any notices required by law in lieu of
communication by postal mail.

15.5 You agree that if Pulumi does not exercise or enforce any legal right or
remedy which is contained in the Terms (or which Pulumi has the benefit of
under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
Pulumi's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to
Pulumi.

15.6 The Terms, and your relationship with Pulumi under the Terms, shall be
governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict
of laws provisions. You and Pulumi agree to submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts located within the King County, Washington to
resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.

15.7 Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations under these
Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written
consent of the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, either party may assign the entirety of its rights and
obligations under these Terms, without consent of the other party, to its
affiliate or in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate
reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets not
involving a direct competitor of the other party. A party’s sole remedy for
any purported assignment by the other party in breach of this paragraph shall
be, at the non-assigning party’s election, termination of your use of the
Pulumi Services upon written notice to the assigning party.

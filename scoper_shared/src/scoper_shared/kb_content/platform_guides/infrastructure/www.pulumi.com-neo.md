## Why Infrastructure and Platform Teams Choose Neo

Neo is the industry's first AI agent built from the ground up to execute,
govern, and optimize complex cloud automation at enterprise scale. Unlike
generic AI tools, Neo understands infrastructure dependencies, respects your
policies, and works within your existing Pulumi governance.

##### 18x Faster Provisioning

Werner Enterprises reduced provisioning time from 3 days to 4 hours. Automate
complex multi-cloud deployments in minutes.

##### 90% Fewer Policy Violations

Neo enforces your governance policies automatically. RBAC, compliance rules,
and security standards built into every action.

##### End-to-End Automation

From provisioning to updates to debugging. Neo handles the full infrastructure
lifecycle, not just code generation.

##### Proven at Scale

“Our goal has always been to minimize the time it takes an engineer to go from
an idea to an experiment in production. We’re excited to see Pulumi pushing
automation further.” — Jk Jensen, Team Lead at Mysten Labs

##### Works With Your Tools

Available in Pulumi Cloud, VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf through
our MCP server.

## What Neo Can Do For You

### Automate Complex Infrastructure Tasks

#### Delegate infrastructure work in plain English with built-in governance:

  * **Natural Language Automation** : “Neo, upgrade all Kubernetes clusters to the latest stable version.”
  * **End-to-End Execution** : Neo understands dependencies, executes changes, monitors outcomes, and maintains compliance.
  * **Human-in-the-Loop Controls** : Configurable approval workflows - you decide how much autonomy Neo has.
  * **Complete Audit Trail** : Every action is previewed, logged, and reversible with full history.

### Get Instant Cloud Insights

#### Ask questions about your infrastructure and get actionable answers:

  * **Cost Optimization** : “What are my least used, most expensive resources?”
  * **Debug Deployments** : “Why did my deployment yesterday fail?”
  * **Compliance Checks** : “Show me any S3 buckets without encryption enabled.”
  * **Multi-Cloud Visibility** : Understand infrastructure across AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and 160+ providers.

### Generate and Fix Infrastructure Code

#### Create, optimize, and debug infrastructure with AI assistance:

  * **Generate Pulumi Programs** : Create infrastructure from prompts in TypeScript, Python, Go, or any supported language.
  * **Fix Errors Automatically** : Neo understands error messages and can fix issues in your infrastructure code.
  * **IDE Integration** : Works in VS Code, Cursor, Claude Code, and Windsurf through our MCP server.
  * **Best Practices Built-In** : Generated code follows Pulumi patterns from millions of production deployments.

# Managed SaaS releases¶

## October SaaS feature announcements¶

_October 2025_

This page provides announcements of newly released features available in
DataRobot's SaaS multi-tenant AI Platform, with links to additional resources.
From the release center, you can also access past announcements and [Self-
Managed AI Platform release notes](../archive-release-notes/index.html).

### Agentic AI¶

#### MCP server template and integration¶

An [MCP server template](https://github.com/datarobot-community/datarobot-mcp-
template) has been added to the [DataRobot
Community](https://github.com/datarobot-community), allowing users to deploy
an MCP server locally or to their DataRobot deployments for agents to access.
Getting the server set up is as easy as cloning the repo and running a few
simple scripts, allowing you to test the server on your local machine or a
fully-deployed custom tool on your DataRobot cluster. The template also
provides instructions for getting several popular [MCP
clients](https://github.com/datarobot-community/datarobot-mcp-
template/blob/main/docs/mcp_client_setup.md) connected to the server, as well
as frameworks for integrating [custom](https://github.com/datarobot-
community/datarobot-mcp-template/blob/main/docs/custom_tools.md) and
[dynamic](https://github.com/datarobot-community/datarobot-mcp-
template/blob/main/docs/dynamic_tool_registration.md) tools to further
customize your MCP setup.

For full instructions, refer to the MCP server template
[ReadMe](https://github.com/datarobot-community/datarobot-mcp-
template/blob/main/README.md).

#### Open-source Milvus now supported as vector database provider¶

You can now create a direct connection to [Milvus](../../gen-ai/vector-
database/vector-dbs.html#connect-to-milvus), in addition to Pinecone and
Elasticsearch, for use as an external data source for vector database
creation. Milvus, a leading open-source vector database project, is
distributed under the Apache 2.0 license. Additionally, you can now select
distance (similarity) metrics for connected providers. These metrics measure
how similar vectors are; selecting the appropriate metric can substantially
boost the effectiveness of classification and clustering tasks.

[![](../../images/distance-vector.png)](../../images/distance-vector.png)

#### New LLMs added¶

With this release, the ever-growing library LLMs is again extended to include
LLMs from Cerebras and TogetherAI. As always, see the full [list of
LLMs](../../reference/gen-ai-ref/llm-availability.html), available for all
enterprise and Trial users subscribed. Leverage the [LLM gateway](../../gen-
ai/genai-code/dr-llm-gateway.html) to access any supported LLMs, leveraging
DataRobot's credentials under-the-hood for experimentation (playground) and
production (custom model deployment), or bring-your-own LLM credentials for
access in production.

#### LLM gateway rate limiting¶

The LLM gateway now enforces rate limits on chat completion calls to ensure
fair and efficient use of LLM resources. Organizations may be subject to a
maximum number of LLM calls per 24-hour period, with error messages indicating
when the limit is reached and when it will reset. To adjust or remove these
limits, administrators can contact DataRobot support.

#### Explore 60+ GPU-optimized containers in the NIM Gallery¶

NVIDIA AI Enterprise and DataRobot provide a pre-built AI stack solution
designed to integrate with your organization's existing DataRobot
infrastructure, which gives access to robust evaluation, governance, and
monitoring features. This integration includes a comprehensive array of tools
for end-to-end AI orchestration, accelerating your organization's data science
pipelines to rapidly deploy production-grade AI applications on NVIDIA GPUs in
DataRobot Serverless Compute.

In DataRobot, create custom AI applications tailored to your organization's
needs by selecting NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NVIDIA NIM) from a gallery
of AI applications and agents. NVIDIA NIM provides pre-built and pre-
configured microservices within NVIDIA AI Enterprise, designed to accelerate
the deployment of generative AI across enterprises.

With the October 2025 release, DataRobot added new GPU-optimized containers to
the NIM Gallery, including:

  * gpt-oss-20b
  * gpt-oss-120b
  * llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5

### Apps¶

#### Talk to my Docs application template¶

Use the [Talk to my Docs application template](https://github.com/datarobot-
community/talk-to-my-docs-agents) to ask questions about your documents using
agentic workflows. This application allows you to rapidly gain insight from
documents across different providers—Google Drive, Box, and your local
computer—via a chat interface to upload or connect to documents, ask
questions, and visualize answers with insights.

Decision-makers depend on data-driven insights but are often frustrated by the
time and effort it takes to get them. They dislike waiting for answers to
simple questions and are willing to invest significantly in solutions that
eliminate this frustration. This application directly addresses this challenge
by providing a plain language chat interface to your documents. It searches
and catalogs various documents to create actionable insights through intuitive
conversations. With the power of AI, teams get faster analysis, helping them
make informed decisions in less time.

#### The CLI tool provides a guided experience for configuring application
templates¶

After opening an application template in a DataRobot Codespace or GitHub,
[launch the CLI tool](../../workbench/wb-apps/app-
templates/index.html#configure-an-app-template-with-the-cli-tool) to guide you
through the process of cloning the application template and successfully
running it, resulting in a built application. The CLI tool provides the
following assistance:

  * Validates environment configurations and highlights missing or incorrect credentials.
  * Guides you through the setup process using clear prompts and step-by-step instructions.
  * Ensures the necessary dependencies and credentials are properly configured to avoid common configuration issues.

#### OpenTelemetry logs for deployments¶

The DataRobot OpenTelemetry (OTel) service now collects OpenTelemetry-
compliant logs, allowing for deeper analysis and troubleshooting of
deployments. The new [**Logs** tab](../../workbench/nxt-console/nxt-activity-
log/nxt-otel-logs.html) in the **Activity log** section lets users view and
analyze logs reported for a deployment in the OpenTelemetry standard format.
Logs are available for all deployment and target types, with access restricted
to users with "Owner" and "User" roles.

The system supports four logging levels (INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR) and offers
flexible time filtering options, including Last 15 min, Last hour, Last day,
or a Custom range. Logs are retained for 30 days before automatic deletion.

[![](../../images/nxt-otel-logs.png)](../../images/nxt-otel-logs.png)

Additionally, the OTel logs API enables programmatic export of logs,
supporting integration with third-party observability tools. The standardized
OpenTelemetry format ensures compatibility across different monitoring
platforms.

#### Quota management for deployments¶

Comprehensive quota management capabilities help deployment owners control
resource usage and ensure fair access across teams and applications. Quota
management is available during [deployment creation](../../workbench/nxt-
registry/nxt-model-directory/nxt-deploy-models.html#quota-management) and in
the [**Settings > Quota** tab](../../workbench/nxt-console/nxt-settings/nxt-
quota-settings.html) for existing deployments. Configure default quota limits
for all agents or set individual entity rate limits for specific users,
groups, or deployments. This system supports three metrics: Requests
(prediction request volume), Tokens (token processing limits), and Input
sequence length (prompt/query token count), with flexible time resolutions of
Minute, Hour, or Day.

[![](../../images/nxt-set-default-quota-definitions.png)](../../images/nxt-
set-default-quota-definitions.png)

In addition, Agent API keys are automatically generated for Agentic workflow
deployments, appearing in the **API keys and tools** section under the **Agent
API keys** tab. These keys differentiate between various applications and
agents using a deployment, enabling better quota tracking and management.

These enhancements prevent single agents from monopolizing resources, ensure
fair access across teams, and provide cost control through usage limits. Quota
policy changes take up to five minutes to apply due to gateway cache updates.

### Platform¶

#### Sharing notification improvements¶

With this release, email notifications have been streamlined when sharing a
Use Case with other members of your team. Previously, an individual email was
sent for each asset within the shared Use Case. Now, all email notifications
for Use Case sharing have been consolidated into a single email.

#### Use Case admin role¶

DataRobot's RBAC functionality has been updated with a new Use Case Admin
role. Users assigned as Use Case Admins can view all use cases in their
organization, rather than being restricted to those they have created or have
been shared with them. This view can be toggled on the Use Cases table:

[![](../../images/org-use-cases.png)](../../images/org-use-cases.png)

For more information, see the Use Case Admin section in the [Use Case
overview](../../workbench/wb-usecase/wb-usecase-overview.html#overview) and
the [RBAC details](../../reference/misc-ref/rbac-ref.html#use-case-admin).

#### Microsoft Azure support for OAuth¶

You can now configure integration with Microsoft Azure as an [OAuth
provider](../../platform/acct-settings/manage-oauth.html#configure-oauth-
provider). Use the [Microsoft Entra ID app](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-
us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) to configure the OAuth
provider.

### Code first¶

#### Python client v3.9¶

v3.9 for DataRobot's Python client is now generally available. For a complete
list of changes introduced in v3.9, view the [Python client
changelog](../../api/reference/changelogs/py-changelog/index.html).

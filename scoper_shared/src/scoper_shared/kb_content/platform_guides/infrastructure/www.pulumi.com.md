## The Complete Platform for Infrastructure Teams

From open source IaC to AI automation, Pulumi provides everything platform
teams need to ship infrastructure faster. One platform that integrates
infrastructure as code, secrets management, policy governance, and AI—no more
stitching together disconnected tools.

##### Real Languages

Use TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, or Java. Full IDE support, testing frameworks,
and package ecosystems. Infrastructure as software.

##### Secure by Default

Encrypted secrets, dynamic credentials, audit trails. SOC 2 Type II certified.
Meet compliance requirements without slowing down.

##### AI for Infrastructure

Generate infrastructure from requirements, reviews PRs, and debugs
deployments, with complete organizational context.

[“Pulumi helped our team to ship a new product faster. We needed **one tool to
setup and manage multi-cloud, multi-region Kubernetes clusters** that
infrastructure and applications teams could use collaboratively”Justin
Fitzhugh, VP of Cloud Platform Engineering](/case-studies/snowflake/)

### Infrastructure as Code in Any Language

Write infrastructure in TypeScript, Python, Go, C#, Java, or YAML. Use real
programming languages with loops, conditions, and functions. Test your code.
Share reusable components. Deploy to any cloud.

tasks.](/images/product/pulumi-neo-tasks.png)

### Meet Neo, Your AI Platform Engineer

The industry’s first AI agent built for infrastructure. Neo understands your
entire infrastructure context, respects your policies, and executes complex
tasks end-to-end. Werner Enterprises reduced provisioning time from 3 days to
4 hours.

Learn more: [Pulumi Neo __](/product/neo)

“Pulumi Neo addresses our biggest challenge of**eliminating the infrastructure
bottleneck** that slows down our entire engineering organization. To get to
market faster, we require infrastructure intelligence that understands our
environment, respects our guardrails, and keeps humans in the loop so we can
**move faster, safely**.”

Richard Genthner, Chief Information Security Officer

### Centralized Secrets & Configuration

Stop juggling multiple vaults and config files. Pulumi ESC provides one
interface for all your secrets—connect HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager,
Azure Key Vault, and more. Generate dynamic credentials with OIDC. Works
everywhere, with or without Pulumi IaC.

governance](/images/product/insights-resource-search.png)

### See and Control Everything

One pane of glass for all your clouds. Search infrastructure with natural
language. Enforce policies automatically. Track compliance in real-time. Find
vulnerabilities before they become incidents.

Learn more: [Pulumi Insights __](/product/insights-governance/)

### Internal Developer Platforms That Scale

Build self-service platforms that engineers actually use. Create templates,
expose approved infrastructure through APIs and portals, and define golden
paths. Let engineers ship faster while platform teams maintain control.

“We’ve spent a lot of time building our internal developer platform. We moved
from a lower-level Terraform and HCL-based interface to Pulumi, letting us use
a custom, higher-level, and much simpler-to-use YAML schema we’ve
defined.**We’ve made cloud infrastructure really easy to use for our
developers.** ”

James Forcier, Staff Software Engineer.

There is no way around the fact that devops is complicated but @PulumiCorp is
a game changer for me. Blows away CloudForamtion, TerraForm, CDK, etc.

Without a doubt the most approachable tool in the IaaC space is @PulumiCorp.
Somewhat enjoying provisioning a scheduled run of a Lambda.

The developer experience of Pulumi is just sublime. As a prior Terraform user,
the grass is substantially greener on this side. I'm so glad I made the switch
two years back. Using Terraform for my current use case would be a massive
downgrade.

bother with JSON, YAML or some other DSL?

@Meliora245

![X](/logos/tech/x.svg)

our team at @devseed is now gravitating toward using
https://pulumi.com/docs/iac/comparisons/terraform/ instead of terraform
because it's all in python so it is easier to onboard new people to the tool
and makes it easier to manage the same infra definition in different test,
staging, and deploy envs.

to build https://planton.cloud. An equivalent of 50K lines of declarative
infra code has been put behind APIs to support the features on the platform

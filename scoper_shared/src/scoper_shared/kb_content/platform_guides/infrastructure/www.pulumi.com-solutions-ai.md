## Benefits for AI

authoring](/images/solutions/ai/ai_author_code.svg)

##### Author Code with AI

The Pulumi authoring experience is dynamic. You can generate a Pulumi program
and deploy it as a template in seconds with a few simple text prompts. Then
you can pair program in your IDE with an AI copilot with suggestions into the
next most likely piece of infrastructure

[Try Pulumi AI](/ai/)

##### Save Costs and Improve Security with AI

Pulumi builds a supergraph of all your organization's infrastructure resources
(managed and not managed by Pulumi) and the relationships between each
resource (e.g., stacks, data types). Pulumi Copilot unlocks insights to
optimize costs, enhance security, and ensure compliance.

##### Provision AI Infrastructure with Python

Pulumi provides an abstraction across all the different layers of your AI
stack (web framework, LLM, containers, databases, secrets, policies,
configurations, etc) as a simple Python library. Through this abstraction you
can manage stacks of infrastructure as code.

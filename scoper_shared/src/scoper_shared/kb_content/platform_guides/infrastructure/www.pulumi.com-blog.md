## [Beyond YAML in Kubernetes: The 2026 Automation Era](/blog/beyond-yaml-
kubernetes-2026-automation-era/)

[![Beyond YAML in Kubernetes: The 2026 Automation Era](/blog/beyond-yaml-
kubernetes-2026-automation-era/kubernetes-2026-ai-automation-
era.png)](/blog/beyond-yaml-kubernetes-2026-automation-era/)

Kubernetes continues to evolve, powering not only applications but entire AI
and ML systems across clouds, edges, and enterprises. By 2026, DevOps
engineers, SREs, cloud engineers, and platform teams face growing pressure to
deliver faster, smarter, and more secure infrastructure at scale.

Kubernetes automation is entering a new era where infrastructure as code,
policy enforcement, and AI-driven orchestration work together to manage cloud
environments intelligently.

Pulumi’s 2025 advancements, including [Pulumi Kubernetes Operator 2.0
GA](https://www.pulumi.com/blog/pko-2-0-ga/), [new Kubernetes best practices
playbooks](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/iac/clouds/kubernetes/guides/playbooks/),
[Pulumi Neo](https://www.pulumi.com/product/neo/) for AI assisted
infrastructure management, and [Policy
Automation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/insights/policy/), set the foundation
for a new era of Kubernetes automation that extends across every role involved
in managing modern infrastructure.

[![Announcing the Next Generation of Pulumi Policies: AI-Accelerated
Governance for the Cloud](/blog/policy-next-gen/meta.png)](/blog/policy-next-
gen/)

The era of AI-accelerated development has created a paradox: the faster
developers move, the bigger the governance challenge becomes. For years,
security and platform teams have worked to “shift left,” but the tools
available have been incomplete. Most focus on detection, which is necessary
but not sufficient. They identify thousands of policy violations across an
organization’s infrastructure but leave teams with an overwhelming backlog and
no scalable way to remediate it. This creates a persistent gap between finding
a problem and fixing it. The result is an impossible choice between
development velocity and organizational control, forcing leadership to slow
down innovation to manage risk.

Today, we end that compromise.

[![New Audit Policy Scans for Pulumi Stacks](/blog/policy-audit-scans-for-
stacks/meta.png)](/blog/policy-audit-scans-for-stacks/)

**Audit Policy Scans for Pulumi Stacks** is part of the next generation of
Pulumi Policies. This capability uses policies to run compliance checks
against the last successful deployment state of your stacks, providing
continuous compliance monitoring without impacting your existing CI/CD
workflows.

Until now, Pulumi’s preventative policies have served as a critical “shift-
left” gate, blocking non-compliant changes during `pulumi up`. While
essential, this created challenges for organizations wanting to roll out new
governance across thousands of existing stacks. This new evaluation mode
solves that problem, giving you a complete and continuous view of your IaC
compliance posture without the friction.

## [Policy Findings Hub: Move From Alert Fatigue to Action](/blog/policy-

[![Policy Findings Hub: Move From Alert Fatigue to Action](/blog/policy-issue-
management/meta.png)](/blog/policy-issue-management/)

For platform and security teams, enabling robust cloud scanning often creates
a new problem: an unmanageable firehose of policy alerts. Identifying a
violation is only the first step. Without a system to manage the lifecycle of
these findings, teams are quickly overwhelmed, leading to prioritization
paralysis and a perpetually growing backlog.

The **[Policy Findings](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/insights/policy/policy-
findings/)** hub in Pulumi Cloud is the solution to this alert fatigue. It’s a
purpose-built, collaborative workspace that turns a noisy list of violations
into organized, actionable tasks. The hub brings clarity and structure to the
compliance process, guiding teams from initial discovery to a verified fix.

## [New Compliance Packs for CIS, NIST, and PCI DSS](/blog/policy-packs-cis-

[![New Compliance Packs for CIS, NIST, and PCI DSS](/blog/policy-packs-cis-
nist-pci/meta.png)](/blog/policy-packs-cis-nist-pci/)

Achieving compliance with industry standards such as **CIS, NIST** , or **PCI
DSS** is a foundational step for every organization. Yet for many teams, it’s
often a manual, months-long process that involves interpreting controls,
authoring custom policies, and validating configurations across multiple
clouds. These challenges often slow progress toward a known and secure cloud
state.

We’re changing that. To simplify this journey, Pulumi launched a new suite of
**pre-built compliance policy packs** for [CIS Controls v8.1, NIST SP 800-53
Rev. 5, and PCI DSS v4.0](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/insights/policy/policy-
packs/pre-built-packs/#available-policy-packs).

These packs are your accelerator for the “**Get Clean** ” journey, allowing
you to enforce critical security and compliance baselines across your cloud
infrastructure **in minutes, not months**.

[![Day 2 Operations: Drift Detection and Remediation](/blog/day-2-operations-
drift-detection-and-remediation/meta.png)](/blog/day-2-operations-drift-
detection-and-remediation/)

Welcome to the fourth post in our **IDP Best Practices** series. Today we’re
diving into the world of drift detection and remediation, those critical day 2
operations that keep your infrastructure aligned with its intended
configuration long after the initial deployment.

You’ve built a beautiful platform with robust guardrails, comprehensive
templates, and well-defined golden paths. Your developers are productive,
deployments are smooth, and everything seems perfect. Then reality hits. An
on-call engineer makes an emergency change through the AWS console during a 3
AM incident. A team member tweaks a security group rule to debug a connection
issue and forgets to revert it. Auto-scaling adjusts capacity based on load
patterns. Before you know it, your actual infrastructure has quietly diverged
from what your code describes.

[![Grounded AI: Why Neo Knows Your Infrastructure](/blog/grounded-ai-why-neo-

infrastructure/)

Ask a generic LLM to “fix my broken deployment,” and you’ll get generic
advice. Ask Pulumi Neo the same question, and you’ll get a fix plan grounded
in your actual infrastructure state.

The difference isn’t about better prompts or newer models. It’s about what the
AI actually knows. Generic LLMs have been trained on the internet. Neo has
been trained on your infrastructure.

### Our purpose

#### To democratize the cloud for every engineer.

We help engineers ship infrastructure faster with Infrastructure as Code in
general-purpose languages.

## Our Values

 __

#### Customers First

When the customer is successful, we are successful, and we always treat our
customers’ success as our highest priority. We wear our customers’ shoes to
understand the world from their perspective and build experiences to delight
them.

__

#### Dream Big

We can’t possibly succeed at our audacious mission by taking small,
conservative steps. Instead, we are lifelong learners who are intellectually
curious, creative, rebellious, and like to dream big. We hire the best and the
brightest, imagine a better future together, and empower our employees to
invent the future.

__

#### Play to Win, as a Team

Being a global and inclusive team enables us to build the best products for
our customers, and everybody has a seat at the table no matter their
background, experiences, or title. We are always raising the bar and
maintaining a high level of team performance in our drive to win as a team. We
celebrate those wins together, learn from our failures together, and are on
this journey as a team together.

__

#### Bias for Action

We make fast decisions, learn from them, and own the outcomes. Good today is
better than perfect tomorrow. When in doubt, we empower action,
experimentation, learning, and iteration. We strive to build internal
consensus so that we are all bought in, but in cases where we disagree, we
disagree, commit, and get going!

__

#### Be an Owner

As early employees, we are owners and behave accordingly. We are frugal, spend
Pulumi’s resources as if they’re our own, and accomplish more with less.

We are looking for new teammates who want to build the future of cloud
infrastructure together.

### Pulumi is about community

Pulumi's Infrastructure as Code SDK is an open source project and our
community inspires everything we do. We're constantly improving the developer
experience of building on the cloud because of our community's feedback and
contributions. Also, we're backed by venture capitalists who believe in our
open source values and the business. Here are some ways that we recognize our
community:

contributions to the community.

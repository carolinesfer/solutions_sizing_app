Modern infrastructure demands modern tools. Pulumi unifies infrastructure as
code, secrets management, policy governance, and AI automation into a single
platform. Start with our Apache 2.0 open source core, scale with enterprise
features when you need them.

### Infrastructure as Code in Any Language

#### Open Source Foundation, Enterprise Scale

Stop wrestling with DSLs. Write infrastructure in TypeScript, Python, Go, C#,
Java, or YAML. Deploy to AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, Kubernetes, and [thousands
of providers](/registry/). Our Apache 2.0 open source engine powers
everything.

![Infrastructure as Code in Any Language](/images/product/pulumi-iac-code.png)

##### Real Programming Languages

Use loops, conditionals, functions, and classes. Catch errors at compile time.
Reuse code across projects.

##### Thousands of Providers

Full API coverage for AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, plus Cloudflare, Datadog,
GitHub, and thousands more.

##### Test Before You Ship

Write unit tests for infrastructure. Run integration tests against ephemeral
environments. Ship with confidence.

#### Automate Infrastructure with Built-in Governance

The industry’s first AI agent built for infrastructure. Neo automates complex
tasks end-to-end, debugs deployments instantly, and generates infrastructure
code - all while respecting your policies and requiring appropriate approvals.

##### End-to-End Automation

Delegate complex tasks in plain English. Neo handles dependencies, executes
changes, and maintains compliance.

##### Instant Cloud Insights

Ask questions, get answers. Find cost savings, debug failures, check
compliance - Neo knows your infrastructure.

### Build Your Internal Developer Platform

#### Enable Self-Service Infrastructure at Scale

Give engineers self-service infrastructure through templates, components, and
developer portals. Platform teams maintain control through policies and
governance. Ship golden paths that engineers actually want to use.

![Pulumi infrastructure as code example](/images/product/idp-services-
home.jpg)

##### Golden Paths

Create reusable components and templates. Platform engineers define patterns
once, engineers use everywhere.

##### Self-Service Options

Code, low-code YAML, or no-code portals. Engineers work how they prefer with
consistent governance.

##### Day 2 Operations

Drift detection, dependency management, enterprise RBAC. Handle the full
infrastructure lifecycle.

##### Migrating from Terraform?

Keep using both or migrate completely. Import existing infrastructure, convert
HCL to real code, migrate state.
